# QWQ

This is a code repository from Group QWQ project for Borealis AI: Let's Solve it 2021.

We use a dataset containing 500 redditors' posts from reddit r/depression with depression classification developed by psychiatrists.  By preprocessing the dataset, cross validation, training and testing the model, we want to predict the depression level and risk of suicide through textual posts. Please see our short report, slides and white paper for more related information.
